### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate mobile developer with **3+ years of experience** building beautiful, high-performance mobile apps.  
My mission is to create user-focused apps that are fast, intuitive, and reliable — whether using **Flutter** or **native iOS** frameworks like **SwiftUI** and **UIKit**.

I’ve worked with startups, agencies, and product teams — shipping apps from scratch, optimizing legacy codebases, and improving performance across platforms.
